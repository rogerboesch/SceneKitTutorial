**Update February 2024**:: I have written the first part of this tutorial almost eight years ago.
SceneKit is available on Vision OS but is no longer used for immersive 3D rendering.
Instead, you have to use RealityKit. But since this information is still very useful,
I have created a little [E-Book](https://visionsos.substack.com) that contains the entire SceneKit Tutorial.


### The Tutorial

The code is part of my SceneKit Tutorial Serie: From Zero to Hero.

### Tutorial
- Chapter 1 - Building a Terrain
- Chapter 2 - Create a real player game object
- Chapter 3 - Add life to your terrain
- Chapter 4 - Implement a Game Loop
- Chapter 5 - Fly smoothly with CoreMotion
- Chapter 6 - Finish the game (The missing parts)

*Remarks*:
- *Code is now updated to be Swift 4 compliant*
- *It's  imortant to know that the code is not intented to learn Swift, but to understand learning game development concepts*
- *Therefore some things (like unwrapping optionals) are just here to make things simpler*


### The Game
This tutorial is a companion work I do parallel on the development of my next upcoming 3D Game which uses just SceneKit and it's written entirely with Swift 4.


### For who is this Tutorial?
It's not for the absolute beginner or novice, because I assume things like Swift notation, trigonometric know-how etc.
On the other hand you don't have to learn all at the begin. Like the terrain class **RBTerrain**.
You can use it just like it is and read the code later again when you have more know-how.
The most important is that you understand the principles.


### Introduction
It's important for me to start directly with a good and solid base which can be used for real games later.
So please don't create a project using the Xcode Project wizard but start directly with the Source on GitHub.
Also I don't want to build a step by step tutorial which shows each line, but always cover a chapter of the Game and introduce
a new component and show the how and why :)

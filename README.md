- **[Part 1 - Building a Terrain](https://rogerboesch.github.io/scenekit/tutorial/games/2016/07/15/scenekit-zerotohero-I.html)**
- **[Part 2 - Create a real player game object](https://rogerboesch.github.io/scenekit/tutorial/games/2016/10/26/scenekit-zerotohero-II.html)**
- **[Part 3 - Add life to your terrain](https://rogerboesch.github.io/scenekit/tutorial/games/2017/12/23/scenekit-zerotohero-III.html)**
- **[Part 4 - Implement a Game Loop](https://rogerboesch.github.io/scenekit/tutorial/games/2017/12/26/scenekit-zerotohero-IV.html)**
- **[Part 5 - Fly smoothly with CoreMotion](https://rogerboesch.github.io/scenekit/tutorial/games/2017/12/27/scenekit-zerotohero-V.html)**
- **[Part 6 - Finish the game (The missing parts)](https://rogerboesch.github.io/scenekit/tutorial/games/2017/12/29/scenekit-zerotohero-VI.html)**
- *Part 7 - ARKit: Play in your environment*
- *Part 8 - Multiplatform: Our game on macOS*
- *Part 9 - tvOS: A great gaming platform*
- *Part 10 - Advanced SceneKit (Ways to improve)*

*Remarks*:
- *Code is now updated to be Swift 4 compliant*
- *It's  imortant to know that the code is not intented to learn Swift, but to understand learning game development concepts*
- *Therefore some things (like unwrapping optionals) are just here to make things simpler*


### The Game
This tutorial is a companion work I do parallel on the development of my next upcoming 3D Game which uses just SceneKit and it's written entirely with Swift 4.


### For who is this Tutorial?
It's not for the absolute beginner or novice, because I assume things like Swift notation, trigonometric know-how etc.
On the other hand you don't have to learn all at the begin. Like the terrain class **RBTerrain**.
You can use it just like it is and read the code later again when you have more know-how.
The most important is that you understand the principles.


### Introduction
It's important for me to start directly with a good and solid base which can be used for real games later.
So please don't create a project using the Xcode Project wizard but start directly with the Source on GitHub.
Also I don't want to build a step by step tutorial which shows each line, but always cover a chapter of the Game and introduce
a new component and show the how and why :)
